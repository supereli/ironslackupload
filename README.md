# ironslackupload

This module uses the iron.io platform in order to add a new Emojee to your slack organization. It also uses the Python imaging library to downsize the image and form upload it to slack. Part of the code was used and implemented from the following Github Slack emojinator:

In addition, instructions for implementing the code in iron.io can be found at www.iron.io

All credentials and links to image are passed through a payload to the service which can be unique to each execution.

The code makes use of and requires use of both the SLACK API and a form upload to an existing Slack organization.
